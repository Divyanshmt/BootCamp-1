# DATA TYPE



**A data type is a kind of data being store in a variable.**


***The latest ECMAScript standard defines six data types:***


1.Boolean:-  It represents only one of two values true or false like On or Off of switch.

For Example:- var a = true;



2.String:- String are text must be inside double and single quotes.

For Example:- var name = "Sita";

3.Null:- It is a value which is explicitly nothing.

var a = null;

4.Number:- It is a type of number can be written with or without a decimal point.Number can be +infinity, -infinity and NaN(not a number).

5.Undefined:- A variable that has no value is undefined like declaration of a variable.

var foo;

6.Symbol:- It is in ES6 value that is unquine.

var symbol = Symbol('$');




According to the mutability(non-primitive) and immutability(primitive):-


Primitive data types are immutable meaning not able to be changed.
Non-primitive data types are mutable meaning able to be changed.



- String,Number,Boolean,Null,Symbol,Undefined are primitive data type.


- Objects are non-primitive data type.
